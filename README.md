Currently not supported:
* ImLive (Too strict captcha protection for scraping)
* LiveJasmin (No nudity in free streams)

There are hundreds of clones of the sites above, you can read about them on [this site](https://adultwebcam.site/clone-sites-by-platform/).

## Requirements
* Python 3
  * Install packages listed in requirements.txt with pip.
* FFmpeg

## Usage

The application has the following interfaces:
* Console
* External console via ZeroMQ (sort of working)
* Web interface (only status)

#### Starting and console
Start the downloader (it does not fork yet)\
Automatically imports all streamers from the config file.
```
python3 Downloader.py
```

On the console you can use the following commands:
```
add <username> <site> - Add streamer to the list (also starts monitoring)
remove <username> [<site>] - Remove streamer from the list
start <username> [<site>] - Start monitoring streamer
start * - Start all
stop <username> [<site>] - Stop monitoring
stop * - stop all
status - Status display 
status2 - A slightly more readable status table
quit - Clean exit (Pressing CTRL-C also behaves like this)
```
For the `username` input, you usually have to enter the username as represented in the original URL of the room. 
Some sites are case-sensitive.

For the `site` input, you can use either the full or the short format of the site name. (And it is case-insensitive)

#### "Remote" controller
Add or remove a streamer to record (Also saves config file)
```
python3 Controller.py add <username> <website>
python3 Controller.py remove <username>
```

Start/stop recording streamers
```
python3 Controller.py <start|stop> <username>
```

List the streamers in the config
```
python3 Controller.py status
```

#### Web interface

You can access the web interface on port 5000. 
It just prints the same information as the status command. 
You can also get a list of the recorded streams.

Further improvements can be expected.

## Docker support

You can run this application in docker. I prefer docker-compose so I included an example docker-compose.yml file that you can use.
Simply start it in the folder with `docker-compose up`.

## Configuration

You can set some parameters in the parameters.py.

## Disclaimer

This program is only a proof of concept and education project, I don't encourage anybody to use it. \
Most (if not every) streamers disallow recording their shows. Please respect their wish. \
If you don't, and you record them despite this request, please don't ever publish or share any recordings. \
If you either record or share the recorded shows, you might be legally punished. \
Also, please don't use this tool for monetization in any way.
